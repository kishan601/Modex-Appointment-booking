Modex Assessment 
This assessment will be taken by approximately 2,500 candidates.
We understand that many will rely on AI tools during the process. However, this is your opportunity to stand out.
To truly differentiate yourself, focus on:
Original thinking and innovation:
Your ideas, structure, and approach should clearly reflect your own creativity—not AI’s generic output.


Strong architecture and clean coding standards
Well-designed systems, scalable patterns, and readable, maintainable code will set you apart from others.


Clear reasoning and problem-solving depth
Show how you think. Document your assumptions, logic, and decisions.
AI can assist, but your innovation, architecture quality, and coding discipline are what will truly distinguish your work.

You may choose to create your own problem statement and solution, with higher weightage given to healthcare-focused projects. However, below are some suggested topics you can work on.
Part 1: Ticket Booking System(Backend)

Duration: 24 hours from the time of assignment
Tech Stack: Node.js, Express.js , Postgres

Objective:
Design and implement a basic ticket booking system that simulates the core functionality of platforms like RedBus or BookMyShow or Doctor Appointment booking. The system must handle high concurrency scenarios to prevent race conditions and overbooking.
Assignment Scope 


1. Functional Requirements
Show/Trip/Slot Management
Admin should be able to create shows or bus trips.


Each entry must include:
Show or Bus Name or doctor name
Start Time
Total Number of Seats (e.g., 40)
User Operations
Users can retrieve a list of available shows/trips.


Users can attempt to book one or more seats for a selected show/trip.
The system must ensure that no overbooking can occur due to concurrent booking requests.
Booking status should include: PENDING, CONFIRMED, or FAILED.


Concurrency Handling
Your solution must handle multiple booking requests for the same seat(s) at the same time.
Implement a strategy to ensure data consistency and atomicity of seat booking operations.
(Optional Bonus) Booking Expiry
Automatically mark a booking as FAILED if it remains in PENDING status for more than 2 minutes.


2. System Design Document (Written Component)
In addition to the working code, submit a brief technical document that outlines how you would scale this system to support a production-grade application similar to RedBus or BookMyShow.
Include the following in your write-up:
High-level system architecture and key components


Database design and how you would scale it (e.g., sharding, replication)


Concurrency control mechanisms (e.g., locks, transactions, queues)


Caching strategy (if any)


Optional: Message queue usage for decoupling critical operations


You may include a basic architecture diagram if needed.
3. Deliverables
Source code hosted in a public GitHub repository


A README.md file with:


Setup instructions


API documentation (Swagger or Postman Collection preferred)


A short technical write-up (PDF or Markdown format) as described above
Must be hosted and accessible 
Evaluation Criteria
Functionality and correctness of API implementation


Handling of concurrency and prevention of overbooking


Code structure, organization, and clarity


Quality of technical design and scalability considerations


Bonus points for use of transactions, locking, and well-documented APIs









Part 2: Ticket Booking System (Frontend)
Duration: 24 hours from the time of backend completion
Tech Stack: React.js, TypeScript
 Required Concepts:
React fundamentals


State management with Context API


Error handling (both UI and API level)


React lifecycle hooks (via functional components and hooks)


Routing with react-router-dom


Efficient API calls (avoid unnecessary re-fetching)


DOM manipulation where necessary


Clean component structure


Objective
Build a frontend application to interact with the backend Ticket Booking System. The app should provide Admin and User views, allowing users to browse shows/trips, book seats, and see booking status in real time.
Functional Requirements
1. Admin Features
Create a new show/trip with:


Show/Bus/Doctor Name


Start Time


Total Seats(not applicable for doctor appointment)


View a list of all shows/trips/slots.


Simple form validation and error handling (invalid inputs, missing fields, etc.).


2. User Features
View available shows/trips/slots.


Select a show/trip/slot and see available seats visually (grid/seat layout).


Book one or more seats(not applicable for doctor appointment).


Show booking status (PENDING, CONFIRMED, FAILED).


Handle errors gracefully (e.g., seats already booked, API errors).


3. Routing
/admin → Admin dashboard (create and list shows)


/ → List of shows/trips/slot for users


/booking/:id → Booking page for a specific show/trip


4. State Management
Use React Context API for:


Authentication state (basic mock auth, no real login required)


Global show/trip/slot data and booking state


5. API Integration
Consume the backend APIs you’ve built (Node.js/Express/Postgres) for:


Show/slot creation


Fetching shows


Booking seats


Use efficient API calls:


Avoid unnecessary re-fetching when navigating between pages


Use caching/memoization where appropriate


6. Error Handling
Show user-friendly error messages for:


API failures


Invalid form submissions


Booking conflicts due to concurrency


Display loading and empty states for lists


7. DOM Interaction
Implement seat selection in the booking page with direct DOM updates for highlighting selected seats before confirming booking.


Ensure proper cleanup when navigating away.


Bonus (Optional)
Implement live updates for seat availability (e.g., via polling or WebSocket mock).


Add seat selection animations.


Create a responsive design for mobile and desktop views.
Deliverables
Source code hosted in a public GitHub repository


README.md containing:


Setup instructions


Any assumptions made


Known limitations


Postman collection or API documentation link


Screenshots or short GIF of the application in use


Evaluation Criteria
Correctness of implementation


Use of Context API and TypeScript types/interfaces


Proper error handling and form validation


Efficient API usage (no redundant requests)


Clean, modular code with reusable components


Good use of lifecycle hooks (via React hooks)


UI/UX quality and responsiveness


Successful deployment of both frontend and backend


















Submission Requirements
